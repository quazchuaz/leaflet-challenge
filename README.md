# leaflet-challenge
Developed a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The final outcome of this project was the creation of a map that assists with visualising earthquake data. data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Popup messages contain additional information about the particular earthquake.
